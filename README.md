# Path-finding-visualizer written in C# and Unity.

A tool I've created in order to help visualize and interact with some of the most famous graph search algorithms such as
A*, Dijkstra, DFS ect.

This project runs on the Unity engine. Make sure to have the newest version installed before running the project. The project folder is called "PathFindingVisualizer"
